# Zomato-Case-Study--Geospatial-Analysis

### Project Overview
**This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and locations.
The goal is to understand the factors influencing restaurant success, food preferences, and regional patterns, providing valuable information for stakeholders in the food industry.**

### Key Features
**Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and normalizing textual data.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Univariate and bivariate analysis of numerical and categorical variables.
Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to uncover patterns.
Geospatial Analysis: Mapping the distribution of restaurants by city and rating using folium.**

### Tools Used
**Python:** The core programming language for analysis.
**Libraries:**
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizing patterns.
folium: For geospatial analysis.

### Results
**The analysis highlights the key factors influencing restaurant success, such as:**

**Cities with the most popular restaurants.
Cuisine preferences based on location.
The correlation between restaurant rating and average cost for two people.**

**The end result will be delivered through visualizations, statistics, and perhaps even geospatial maps**
